# MPMB 5.1E/One D&D UA Content
This script adds all of the content from the 2022-2023 series of Unearthed Arcana articles to the MPMB sheets. This includes code that adds all official WotC subclasses to these UA classes.

**This script is not to be used in conjunction with the individual scripts I have made for each of the 5.1E/One D&D UA articles.**

**Script Credit Note:**
A lot of the content of this script is either ripped directly from existing code or is an altered form of existing code. I have tried to diligently note when I copied code from elsewhere, but I probably missed some instances. A lack of note saying I ripped the code from elsewhere either means that I wrote that section of code entirely myself or that the code that was copied to use as a starting point was so heavily altered by me that almost nothing of the copied code exists.

*Further Credit Notes:*
- I will note that the Monk class & class options code was done by user "Nod" instead of myself. Much thanks to Nod for providing the code they had already written for the class and making my life easier. I did make some edits to make sure it conformed to the source referencing scheme in the rest of my scripts, but I otherwise left it largely unaltered.
- The Weapon Mastery Code was made by user "Joost/MorePurpleMoreBetter".
- The code for the "Two-Handed Improvised Weapon" was made with help from user "TrackAtNite".

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2024-05-23:**
  - Initial upload of script.
- **2024-05-26:**
  - Fixed a bug preventing the 2014 Wizard spells from appearing in the "Set Spells: Wizard" dialog window's "Spellbook" column.

**Known Bugs:**
- A lot of the Monk subclasses don't appear in the "Subclass / Archetype" selection dropdown in the "Class Selection" dialog window, but they do appear in the dialog window when the Monk reaches lvl 3 and doesn't pick a subclass with the dropdown.
  - As such, the current workaround solution is to just leave the "Subclass / Archetype" field blank in the "Class Selection" dialog window, click "Apply", then use the new dialog window the sheet brings up to pick your Monk subclass.
- ~~The 2014 Wizard spells are not showing up in the "Set Spells: Wizard" dialog window's "Spellbook" column, though they do show up in the "Bonus Spells" column.~~ Fixed on 2024-05-26. Thank you to users "TrackAtNite" & "PoetOfGod" for their help in fixing this bug.

- Also included is an alternate form of the "Epic Boon of Irresistible Offense" Feat that operates as it was actually written in *UA23PT5*. This version of the Feat is set to be excluded by default, because as it was written in the original article, the bonus damage on a Nat 20 could be added to both weapon **AND** spell attacks, which seems unintended for a Feat that only increases Str or Dex. The version in the above list has been coded such that it only adds the bonus damage to weapons.
